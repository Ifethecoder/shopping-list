# shopping-list
Sometimes, we return home from a store and realize we forgot to buy something. Other times, we get to a store and waste more time than we should because we are trying to remember what to buy. I have experienced these scenarios and have created a website to allow me make a list of items I want to buy and check items off the list as I buy them.
